- Show repository hour creation time in addition to the day of creation
- Show relative repository creation time (time from now) in addition to the other informations
- Add ability to edit ACL users, rather than deleting an ACL and adding another one
- Add refresh button for repositories (and SSH keys)

- Handle browser back button for all actions
- Make everything keyboard-accessible (with tab, space and enter)
- Add changelog link in footer

- Improve detection of disabled JavaScript
- Reduce server-side requests timeout delay and improve network error messages
- Reduce requests to BLIH server by caching repository informations (UUID and creation time) and by locally removing a freshly-deleted repository instead of refreshing the list
- Improve AJAX request cancellation (for example, if the user closes a repository modal before the requests finished)
- Improve ACL error handling, on both repository creation and ACL save
- Fix invalid English in BLIH error messages
- Sort ACL alphabetically (by login)
- Avoid modal jumping on repository view if there is only one ACL
- Improve overall responsiveness on mobile devices
